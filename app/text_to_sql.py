Write ONE valid SQLite SELECT query that answers the user's question.

Rules:
- Only produce a SELECT query. Never write INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or DROP.
- Only use the tables and columns in the schema below.
- If the user asks about a category or brand by name, join to the categories/brands tables.
- The schema gives "sample_values" for text columns. Prefer matching those exactly.
- Match text case-insensitively and allow singular/plural wording: compare with LIKE
  and wrap the value in %, e.g.  WHERE lower(c.name) LIKE lower('%laptop%').
- Return ONLY the SQL query, with no explanation and no markdown fences.
