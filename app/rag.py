rag.py — FEATURE 2: answer store-policy questions from data/faq.md.

This is the RAG pipeline you built in Colab, now as a reusable function:
  question -> search the vector store -> stuff chunks into a prompt -> grounded answer.
The vector store must already exist (run: python -m scripts.build_vectorstore).
